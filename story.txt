Our story begins in the year 3030 in Berlin, where all varieties of pants other than lederhose are now illegal.
The members of Rammstein, fortunately, viewed this as nothing but an absolute win.
Since the new age klimaanlage had quite the reputation for breaking down, and none of them wanted to experience another bratwurst kerfuffle.
With lederhose becoming the standard in Berlin, Rammstein fans were roaming rampant in the street searching for the lederhose, leading to a wettbewerbsfaehig lederhose market.
Meanwhile, at the Biergarten, locals were enjoying Apfelkuchen and plotting how to sneak a Porsche past the lederhose patrols. (cgwatari)
