Our story begins in the year 3030 in Berlin, where all varieties of pants other than lederhose are now illegal.
The members of Rammstein, fortunately, viewed this as nothing but an absolute win.
Since the new age klimaanlage had quite the reputation for breaking down, and none of them wanted to experience another bratwurst kerfuffle.
With lederhose becoming the standard in Berlin, Rammstein fans were roaming rampant in the street searching for the lederhose, leading to a wettbewerbsfaehig lederhose market.
Meanwhile, at the Biergarten, locals were enjoying Apfelkuchen and plotting how to sneak a Porsche past the lederhose patrols. (cgwatari)
The Porsche was full of counterfit lederhose, disguised as baeckerei supplies and smuggled across the border from the Netherlands.
Their plot was nearly foolproof and considered every detail except one... the HUNDS.
The hunds were transported through Dirndels (Traditional dress) in suitcases by Electric Callboy (Metal german band) to help attack the Rammstein fans.
But the Rammstein fans are ruthless and would not back down from a fight; they heard of these plans and stocked up on bratwurt to help distract the hunds.
The two groups collided on Hauptstrasse where a kerfuffle ensued, forcing the Rammstein fans to use the baeckerei supplies, as the hunds wanted their bratwurst served with brot.
